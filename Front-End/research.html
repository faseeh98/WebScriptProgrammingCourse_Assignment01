		<p>My primary research interest is in the area of networks and distributed computing systems. New generations of networked computing systems, aided by the global presence of the Internet infrastructure, are playing an increasingly important role in the society. Such increasing reach is making the demand for robust operation of such systems more stringent than ever. Failures or anomalies in these systems can now have enormous cost and serious consequences on our society. 
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, the dramatic increase in heterogeneity of the networked devices such as handhelds and embedded computers is making the building of integrated information systems ever more challenging. Investigating the principles underlying the design and implementation of such robust and pervasive networked computing systems is the general goal of my research. How to build a reliable system using unreliable components and how local algorithms based on local knowledge can derive globally emergent system characteristics such as reliability, availability, efficient resource utilization and quality assurance, are the central questions that drive most of my research activities. Because real-world systems are complex, answering these questions requires careful design and implementation that attends the details of the real scenario. I also use theoretical analysis and simulation that allows exploration of design parameters in wider ranges and in isolation, and helps to understand the impact of each parameter on the observed behavior of the system.

		      		The recent expansion in the development of unconventional sources of natural gas in the United
					States, specifically the Marcellus Shale-rich state of Pennsylvania, has generated policy and public
					controversy. The media discourse about fracking in central Westmoreland County has often been
					negative, based on media coverage, newspaper articles, and the development of numerous
					opposition groups. This study uses Q-methodology to examine emergent perspectives and subdiscourses within the fracking opposition debate in central Westmoreland County, PA. The
					analysis reveals four different narratives of perspectives amongst people actively involved in
					locally opposing fracking, labeled (1) Future Fears; (2) Local Resistor (3) Community Concerns;
					and (4) Distrust Stakeholders and Turn towards Renewables. The conflicts that emerge across
					these four extracted factors are indicative of deeper discourse within the fracking debate that
					signifies diversity in motivations, values, and convictions. The disparity in viewpoints point to
					fundamental disagreements over standard fracking processes, stakeholder decisions, and the future
					of fracking. Unraveling these core areas of dissent can offer tangible data upon and insights which
					policymakers can base future fracking campaigns.

		      		Soil sustainability will play a key role in maintaining crop production in the face of
					decreased precipitation due to global climate change. A field study that compared fields with
					similar soil types farmed with varying soil conserving practices was conducted in central Ohio to
					determine if practices such as no-till and cover crops can influence soil moisture through the
					build-up of soil organic matter. Soil moisture samples were taken 23 times throughout the season
					at depths of 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm. Soil samples for organic matter determination were
					collected once at the end of the growing season. This study found that soil water content was not
					increased by use of reduced tillage or cover crops when compared to fields that had not used
					conservation practices. However, study design and the wet season, central Ohio received above
					average rainfall in 2015, limited the studyâ€™s ability to explore relationships between SOC and
					moisture retention and thus prevents drawing conclusions about prospects for management to
					improve soil water holding capacity

		      		Following the DDT-induced population collapse in the mid-twentieth century, peregrine
					falcons were extirpated throughout Pennsylvania. As a result of decades of recovery efforts,
					peregrine falcon populations have experienced rapid growth, and their populations are still
					expanding. Yet, the majority of occupied nest sites are no longer on cliff sites along major river
					corridors, but rather on anthropomorphic structures, such as bridges, buildings and smokestacks.
					This study focuses on the recovering peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) population in eastern
					North America. This study examines peregrine falconsâ€™ proclivity for habitat imprinting on
					anthropomorphic structures for breeding. The study also examines sex-biased differences in
					dispersal from banding to breeding site.
					Archival data from the Pennsylvania Game Commissionâ€™s (PGC) Peregrine Falcon
					Research Management Program annual reports, 1994-2013, were used to assess peregrine
					behavior. Female peregrine falcons showed significantly longer average dispersal distances
					(243.7 km, n=54) than males (111.2 km, n=32). Peregrine falcons banded on anthropomorphic
					structures showed statistically significant nesting preferences to urban structures, however not
					absolute (n=87). These findings have important management implications for meeting
					Pennsylvaniaâ€™s targeted population goals for endangered species delisting. Since a primary
					component of recovery is to increase cliff nest sites, the findings may assist in efforts to identify
					suitable sites and determine limiting factors to achieve the targeted population recovery
